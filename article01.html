            <p>At 10.30pm on Monday evening last in a warehouse in Kea Lew Business Park in Portlaoise the last three seats on Laois County Council were finally             filled, bringing an end to a three-day process of tallying, sorting, counting and re-counting that had got underway just after 9am on Saturday                     morning across town in St Mary’s Hall.It was a marathon saga that entailed three excruciatingly long days but it ended with an absolute bang – six elections in      the space of an hour, each one of them greeted more raucously than the last.</p>
            
            <p>The announcements all weekend had been joyously celebrated but things went up a notch when Mary Sweeney and her gang belted out the Skies Oer Ballyroan at half 8 on Monday following her fifth straight election in Portlaoise. Ben Brennan’s huge support base, who’d waited around patiently and with good humour all weekend, got their moment next at the same time as his new colleague Aisling Moran, retaining the seat in Graiguecullen-Portarlington previously held by her father John for Fine Gael since 1991.</p>
            
            <p>Then it was the turn of Thomasina Connell for the final seat in Portlaoise – again for Fine Gael – before the triple whammy in the gripping Borris-Mountmellick battle of 25-year-old Conor Bergin, Durrow’s Oliver Clooney and outgoing Cathaoirleach John King. Clooney’s crowd even cracked open the champagne. For the candidates – winners and losers – their families, the Count Centre staff, Returning Officer Donal Brennan, the Gardai, Bosco Ramsbottom and his catering team and the working media, it brought the curtain down on an intense weekend. Dramatic and enjoyable as it was, there was nobody sorry to see the back of the place.</p>
            
            <p>Yet an Election Count is a unique experience for so many reasons. The setting couldn’t be any more unglamorous if it tried. Bare concrete floors, a cavernous big building, various sections separated by sheets of plywood and most people surviving on bars of chocolate, bottles of mineral and tea or coffee out of paper cups.For those consumed in it, they’re in a bubble for those couple of days, almost oblivious to what else is going on in the world. Those not at it get a snapshot of the drama through social media but you only get a full sense of it all by being there.It’s a place where all walks of life come together, all backgrounds, religions and ages. And it’s somewhere you’ll witness every human emotion in the rawest form: excitement, nerves, tension, disappointment, pride, joy, anger, bitterness, sadness and everything in between. By the end of it all, 19 county councillors, across three different areas had been elected to serve the people of Laois for the next five years.</p>
